This repo containes all of the class work for the class.

Each assignment has its own button on the main page.

The synth is the Project I pick for the class.

Everything is using react (create-react-app) as a starting point.
For the Synth Project I used this as a base https://medium.com/geekculture/building-a-modular-synth-with-web-audio-api-and-javascript-d38ccdeca9ea (Article uses base html/css/js no react)
